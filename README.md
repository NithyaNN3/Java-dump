> Iteration 1: Get word from a game setter -> get the player to words 6 times trying to guess the final word
> If the letter is in the right position, output the position of the letter and say "Letter in pos x is correct"
> If the letter is in the word but not in the right position, output "Letter is in the word but not in the right position"
> If the letter isn't in the word, output "Letter doesn't exist in the word"
